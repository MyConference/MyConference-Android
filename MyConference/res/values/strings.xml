	<string name="travel_text_1">Shanghai sits at the mouth of the Yangtze River, 
	    the longest river in China. Though no match for the long history of Beijing and Xian, 
	    yet Shanghai has a unique story to tell: starting from a fishing village opened up 1842, 
	    Asia\'s leading city in the 1920s and 1930s dubbed as \"Paris of the East\", and today Shanghai
	     has become one of the world\'s largest metropolitan cities,the largest economic and 
	     transportation center in China. It best shows where China is headed in the 21th 
	     century as well as a museum of East meeting West on Chinese soil.</string>
	<string name="travel_text_2"><b>A Brief History</b>\n
		About 6.000 years ago, the western part of today\'s Shanghai dried up
		 into land and its eastern part became a piece of land about 2.000 years ago.\n
		Shanghai began as Huating County, an administrative district established in 751 AD.
		 The county, located in an area known today as Songjiang District, had its boundary 
		 reaching today\'s Hongkou District in the north, Xiasha in the east and the coast in
		  the south. In 991 AD, Shanghai Town was set up in the county.\n
		During the 1260-1274 period, the town evolved into an important trading port. 
		On August 19th, 1291 during the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368), the then central government 
		approved the establishment of Shanghai County in this area. Hence this day became the
		 anniversary of the founding of the city of Shanghai.\n
		In the 16th century (or the middle period of the Ming Dynasty), Shanghai became the 
		national center of textile and handicraft industry. In 1685, Shanghai set up its first 
		customs office. After the Opium War in the mid-19th century, Shanghai served as a major 
		trading port and gateway to inland China. With invasion of the big powers from across 
		the world, Shanghai was then turned into a semi-feudal and semi-colonial city for about 
		100 year. On May 27, 1949, the People\'s Liberation Army of the Communist Party of China 
		took control of Shanghai and since then Shanghai has undergone a historic transformation.</string>
	<string name="travel_text_3"><b>Climate</b>\n
		<p>Weather during November to April is the coldest and temperatures range between 
		3.5oC to 13.7oC (38.3oF to 56.7oF). Weather in May, June, September and October 
		is cooling, ranging between 18.6oC to 23.5oC (65.5oF to 74.3oF). Climate in July
		 and August starts to turn hot and temperature can go up to 28oC (82.4oF) or above.</p></string>
	<string name="travel_text_4"><b>Population</b>\n
		<p>Due to constant inflow of people from other parts of the country, 
		the population in Shanghai keeps growing. When Shanghai was turned into a city,
		 it had only a population of less than 100,000. By the end of 2006, however, the city\'s 
		 permanent residents had grown to nearly 13.7 million, or 1% of China\'s population. 
		 In 2006, an average 2,157 permanent residents lived on each square kilometer of the city.</p></string>
	<string name="travel_text_5"><b>Cultural and Historical Sites</b>\n
		<p>By the end of 2006, Shanghai has 19 cultural and historical sites listed under the 
		state protection and 165 under the city protection. A number of ancient sites and 
		gardens dating back to Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties have been well preserved. 
		Well-known sites include Yuyuan Garden, Longhua Temple, Jade Buddha Temple, Confucius Temple, 
		and Zhujiajiao Ancient Water Town. Shanghai has also many precious relics and sites 
		featuring its revolutionary history, such as the site of the first National Congress 
		of the Communist Party of China, Residences of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, Mao Zedong, and Zhou Enlai.</p></string>
	<string name="travel_text_6"><b>Tourist Scenes</b>\n
		While Shanghai lacks the classical Chinese royal palaces, gardens and monuments of 
		Beijing, its colonial legacy and international character give it a character of its own 
		â€“ a museum of East-meets-West and a mix of modernity and tradition. Modern Shanghai 
		attracts the attention of the whole world. Visitors are flocking here, drawn by curiosity, 
		a sense of possibility, the lure of potential professional and financial success, or perhaps 
		simply a desire to be in one of the coolest, brashest, and most exciting cities in 
		the new century. The most popular tourist scenes in Shanghai include the Bund, People\'s 
		Square, Orient Pearl Broadcasting and Television Tower, Jin Mao Tower, Global Finance 
		Center (which has a nickmane of bottle opener), and Shanghai Xintiandi.</string>
	<string name="travel_text_7"><b>Food and Shopping</b>\n
		Shanghai is also known as a paradise for eating and shopping. Shanghai\'s restaurants 
		are among the finest to be found in China. There are more than 30,000 chain-store-style 
		restaurants serving Chinese and Western-style food and delicacies from other Asian regions. 
		The foreign-style restaurants feature food from more than 30 countries, including Italy, 
		France, Japan, Portugal, and India while the Chinese ones feature food from more than 20 
		regions of China. The famous restaurant areas are at the City God Temple area, Yunnan Road, 
		Henan Road, Zhapu Road and Xianxia Road. For shopping buffs, Shanghai is known as \"the Oriental Paris\". 
		Nanjing Road, Huaihai Road, Super Brand Mall, the Grand Gateway, Plaza 66 and Xujiahui Shopping 
		Center are the top choices.</string>
